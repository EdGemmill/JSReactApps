# The DOM and JavaScript

This page contains concise guidance on how to perform simple updates on a
webpage using JavaScript. Once you're comfortable with the basic methods
described below, you can
[research other ways to interact with the page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#core_interfaces_in_the_dom).

You may want to read or just skim through this page, or use the index below to

## What is the DOM?

When the web browser reads an HTML page sent by a server (perhaps like the web
page you're reading right now), it builds up a "tree" of elements in memory.
From this tree, the elements are then displayed (or "painted") in the web
browser window.

For example, let's say a browser reads the following HTML page:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Zoe's Cooking Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my cooking blog!</h1>
    <p>Check out my latest pudding recipe!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The browser will build the following "tree" of elements in memory:

![The DOM tree](../images/dom-tree.png)

This is called the DOM representation of the page. "DOM" stands for Document
Object Model - a representation of the different elements and their hierarchy.

Without JavaScript, this tree is fixed, and there is no way to change the page.
But we can use JS functions to modify it dynamically. We also say we can
**change the DOM tree**, which is another way to say we're **changing the
elements on the page**.

To run through the following sections, you may use the previous HTML code and
save it to an HTML file. Open the page with your browser and use the developer
console to run the JavaScript code snippets.

## Get one element by its HTML tag name

The function `document.querySelector` is very versatile ‚Äî first, we can use it
to query a specific element on the page by using its tag name.

For example, in the HTML page from the example above, we can query the paragraph
element `<h1>` (main heading) like this:

```js
// 1. We store a "handle" into a variable
const titleElement = document.querySelector("h1");

// 2. We can now interact with the element, e.g modify its text content
titleElement.textContent = "This is a new title";

// We can shorten the two lines above like this:
document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "This is a new title";

// 3. Other things that we could do with the element:

// a. Hide it
titleElement.style.display = "none";

// b. Show it again
titleElement.style.display = "block";

// c. Set its HTML id (if you don't know what this is, read the section about HTML IDs below)
titleElement.id = "introduction";

// d. Set its HTML class (if you don't know what this is, read the section about HTML classes below)
titleElement.className = "blue-paragraph";
```

Try some of the snippets above on the example web page, or on a website you
made - or even any other website that you're browsing.

### But where do I run this code?

The code snippets in this page can be run in two ways:

- as JavaScript files included on the page using a `<script>` HTML tag
- directly
  [from the developer console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/javascript/)

### But what is `document`?

The object `document` is the one we use to access the different methods
described here. It is natively accessible when running JS in a browser
environment ‚Äî which is why we don't have to define it ‚Äî and it comes with a lot
of useful methods to interact with the page.

## Get an array of elements

```js
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
```

Something to bear in mind:

- If we use `document.querySelector`, only the first matching element will be
  returned.
- If we use `document.querySelectorAll`, all the matching elements will be
  returned.

## Get one element by its HTML ID

> In HTML, we can add an `ID` to an element - this is a label that we, the
> developer, are choosing to **uniquely identify** this element on the page.
> This means the same ID cannot be reused twice in the page, so make sure it's
> specific enough.

```html
<p id="introduction"></p>
```

This ID can be used in CSS to target the element with some custom styling ‚Äî but
we can also use it with `document.querySelector` to target specifically an
element by its ID.

The syntax used to do this is called a **selector** - if you've used
`querySelector` to get an element by its tag name, you've already used
selectors. A tag name is, on its own, a selector:

- `p` targets any `<p>` element
- `h1` targets any `<h1>` element
- `body` targets the `<body>` element

To be more specific and get an element by its ID, we use the ID prefixed by the
`#` character:

- `p#name` targets only the `<p id="name">` element
- `h1#big-title` targets only the `<h1 id="big-title">` element

Therefore, to query the `<p>` element from the code snippet above, we'd run the
following JS code:

```js
const paragraph = document.querySelector("p#introduction");
```

## Get one element by its HTML class

> In HTML, we can add a `class` to an element - this is a label that we, the
> developer, are choosing. Unlike IDs, we can tag many elements with the same
> class name.

The way to query elements by their class name is similar to the one we use for
IDs ‚Äî but instead of using the `#` sign as a prefix, we're using the dot (`.`):

- `p.name` targets **all** the `<p class="name">` elements

Once again:

- If we use `document.querySelector`, only the first matching element will be
  returned.
- If we use `document.querySelectorAll`, all the matching elements will be
  returned.

## Adding a new element on the page

With JavaScript, we can also dynamically create new elements on the page. This
can be done by following a the following steps:

1. Use `document.createElement` to make a new element
2. Setup any properties for this element, such its the text content
3. Add it on the page with the `.append()` method

For this last step, we can't just add an element anywhere on the page.

Remember that the browser keeps a "tree" representation of all the elements. To
insert something new, we need to be specific about **where in the tree** we'd
like to insert it. This can be done by getting its "parent" element, and then
adding it as a "leaf".

```js
// 1. Make a new element - specifying the tag name
const newElement = document.createElement("p");

// 2. Set its text content
newElement.textContent = "Hey there, I'm new";

// 3. Append it to the body
const body = document.querySelector("body");
body.append(newElement);
```

## Removing an element from the page

The process to remove an element from the page is more straightforward - first,
we get the element (using `.querySelector` for example), then we call the
`.remove()` method on it.

```js
// 1. Query the element
const elementToRemove = document.querySelector("p#my-paragraph");

// 2. Remove it
elementToRemove.remove();
```
